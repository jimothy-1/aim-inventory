Deleted the Shelf C file, looks like it fixed the issue we were having


I made the link more generic so that anyone should be able to access it.
I shortened the link to:
- - -
https://erp.aimdynamics.com/web#id={{ warehousereader.lines['odoo_id'] }}&model=product.product

Just in case, here's the old code (better than nothing)
- - -
<a href="https://erp.aimdynamics.com/web#id={{ warehousereader.lines['odoo_id'] }}&action=377&model=product.product&view_type=form&cids=1&menu_id=200" target="_blank" id="update_button">Update Odoo</a>
